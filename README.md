# ultraloom

A check chain that puts one interface in front of ruff, eslint, gdlint, mypy,
tsc, pytest, vitest and coverage — and an optional graph harness for agent
flows.

## The check chain

    uvx ultraloom check lint
    uvx ultraloom check types
    uvx ultraloom check test
    uvx ultraloom check coverage --threshold 100

No installation in your project, no LLM dependency, no API key. The tool for
each check comes from a language preset; the place it runs comes from your
project's `.ultraloom/config.toml`.

## The harness (optional)

    uv add "ultraloom[agent]"

Runs a flow as a graph: nodes are steps, edges are transitions with
conditions. It journals every step, stops at approval points, and resumes an
aborted run from where it stopped.
