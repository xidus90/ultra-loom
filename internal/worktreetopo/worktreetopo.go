// One git call for both answers, and that call is `git worktree list
// --porcelain`. Not a comparison of `--git-dir` against `--git-common-dir`:
// those two are not comparable as text. CLAUDE.md records a directory under
// `.claude/worktrees/` that shared the main index, where git answered
// `C:/Users/micro/Documents/#GIT/ultraloom/.git` for the first and
// `../../../.git` for the second -- one directory in two spellings, which as
// text differ, so the comparison called a shared-index directory a worktree.
