// The split is what makes --dry-run honest: Prepare answers "what would
// change?" by reading only, and Commit is the same answer applied. Nothing
// Commit does can change an answer Prepare gave, because every decision was
// taken before the first byte landed.
//
// It does not make the write a transaction. A failure on the third file
// leaves the first two on disk, and this package offers no undo -- Commit
// names them instead, so a caller can report exactly what landed rather than
// claiming nothing did. Temporary names and a rename at the end would not
// change that: renaming three of five can fail on the fourth just as well.
// What it does guarantee is that init only ever adds: anything already standing under
// a name -- file, directory, symlink, even one pointing nowhere -- is skipped,
// and Commit refuses rather than overwrites whatever is there when it arrives.
// Whatever a failed run leaves behind, none of it is somebody else's content.
