// Package junction makes one directory point at another on Windows.
//
// A junction and not a symlink: `os.Symlink` creates a symbolic link, which
// needs a privilege or Developer Mode, and `ln -s` under MSYS silently copies
// instead -- that mistake cost 3.7 GB of Godot editor once. A junction needs
// no privilege and is what the hand-made links in this repository's worktrees
// already are.

// Target is the directory `link` points at, or "" when it points at nothing.
//
// A path that is not a link, and a path that is not there at all, are both the
// empty answer with no error: the sweep asks this about every candidate it
// scans, and neither case is a fault. Anything else is a fault and says so.
//
// The answer is the target as Windows stores it, `\??\C:\dir\` and not the
// path a caller could open. Two reasons, and neither is that the prefix
// identifies anything -- the tag does that, and this checks the tag. First,
// the stored substitute name is what the kernel actually resolves; the print
// name beside it in the same buffer is decoration a tool may set to anything.
// Second, turning it into something openable means deciding what that is --
// trailing separator, short names, volume GUID -- and that decision belongs to
// the one caller comparing paths, in one place, not to this package.
//
// The reparse-point ioctl and not `os.Lstat` plus `os.Readlink`, measured on
// 2026-09-07 with go1.27.0 windows/amd64: by default Lstat reports a junction
// as `Lrw-rw-rw-` and Readlink answers it, but under
// `GODEBUG=winsymlink=1,winreadlinkvolume=1` the mode is `?rw-rw-rw-`
// instead: ModeIrregular, no ModeSymlink. Both settings carry `Changed: 23` in
// the toolchain's own `internal/godebugs/table.go`, so that is the default for
// every `go` directive from 1.23 on -- and that path would answer "" for a
// real junction, which is not an error a caller could notice. Bumping this
// module's `go 1.22` line would silently turn the sweep blind. Widening the
// test to ModeIrregular is no answer either: the bit covers every other
// reparse tag as well, and Readlink has no answer for most of them.
