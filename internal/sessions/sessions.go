// write: `ulguard hook session-start` puts one down at session start -- it took
// that over from `session_start.py` (fa3dd38), deleted in 6a7037a -- `stop.py`
// rewrites it on every block and every pass, and `subagent_start.py` on every
// subagent dispatch. Read here rather than through the Python side, because the reader is
// a Go binary that must run in a worktree where the Python runtime is exactly
// what is still missing.
