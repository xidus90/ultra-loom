// Base is a string and not a pointer. state.py tells None from a value, and
// the empty string is never a commit any of these files could hold, so both
// absences are one. What must not collapse is the file: an absent base is
// written as JSON null, because the Python side keeps reading these files for
// as long as both sides run.

	// wrote it, which is what a golden comparison over these files reads.
	//
	// Key order is all it buys. The two encoders do not agree on the bytes and
	// cannot be made to: measured on 2026-09-10, json.dumps puts a space after
	// every `:` and `,` where Marshal puts none, and their escaping diverges in
	// both directions -- for the snapshot key `ä<b`, Python's default
	// ensure_ascii=True writes `\u00e4<b` while Marshal writes the letter raw
	// and escapes the `<` as `\u003c`.
