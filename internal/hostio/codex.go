// ErrNoAdapter is returned by a host arm that exists as a promise and not as

// names which host and what is missing.

// readCodex is the seam and not an adapter.
//
// Codex is not installed on the development machine, and its hook contract
// could not be computed from there: what is documented is that it has a
// `hooks/hooks.json` mechanism -- suppressed by an empty `hooks` object in
// `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` -- and that it "runs no session-start hook"
// (superpowers/6.3.0/docs/porting-to-a-new-harness.md:243 and the harness
// table at :788). That same page warns that a hook *system* is not a
// session-start *event*: one harness carried the string SessionStart in its
// binary while firing only pre/post-tool and stop.
//
// So this refuses. A guessed adapter would look exactly like a working one,
// and ultra-brain has already paid for that shape once: on 2026-09-06 its
// deny envelope went unread on Antigravity and a probe file landed on disk
// anyway, with only exit 2 having any effect
// (docs/.superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-go-hooks-drei-hosts-design.md:104-108).

// at all, across three configurations, and the counter-probe by hand ruled out
// the script, the path, the schema and the workspace trust as causes
// (docs/.superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-antigravity-hook-messung.md, finding 4).
//
// Forwarding to readClaude would therefore assert a shape nobody has seen. It
// may well be the same object-shaped payload with the event under another key,
// but "may well be" is what a guessed adapter is made of, and it would look
// exactly like a working one.

// Answering it needs an interactive session or one of the two permission
// relaxations agy itself names, both of which are the user's decision. The
// fallback if the answer turns out to be no is prose in GEMINI.md rather than
// a hook.
