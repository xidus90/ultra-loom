// Package hostio is the seam between a hook's work and the host that calls it.
//
// One normalised payload in, one normalised answer out. The core packages see
// these two types and never a JSON envelope, so a second host costs an adapter
// and not a second copy of the hook.
//
// The host arrives as a flag and is not guessed from the payload. Guessing was
// the first design -- `tool_input.file_path` for Claude against `TargetFile`
// for Antigravity, the way `brain guard` does it -- and it cannot work here:
// the four events these hooks answer are not tool events at all. SessionStart,
// Stop and the subagent pair carry no `tool_input`, so there is nothing to
// recognise. The flag is not a second place for the same truth either, because
// ulinit writes both host files from one table and knows the host as it builds
// the command.
