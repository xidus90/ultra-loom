// It refuses exactly what that module refuses and nothing more: stdin that is

// payload.py words them, so the two hooks say the same thing for as long as
// both exist.
//
// The fields are read by type assertion rather than decoded into a struct, so
// a value of the wrong type reads as absent instead of as damage. That is not
// laxity, it is where the decision belongs: payload.py's whole job is "is this
// an object", and what counts as a usable session id is decided one layer up,
// by `recordBase` in cmd/guard, which files nothing when there is no usable id
// -- as `_record_base` in session_start.py (fa3dd38):52 did, returning without
// a word when the id was not a string. A struct decode would refuse
// `{"session_id": 5}` and exit 1 where the Python hook exited 0.
