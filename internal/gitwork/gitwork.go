// repository without a commit -- `git init` leaves HEAD naming a branch that
// does not exist yet -- and a root git ignores. The last one is why the ignore
// check is asked here at all: such a directory *is* inside a repository, so
// rev-parse answers readily with the surrounding repository's HEAD, and
// measuring against that is worse than not measuring, because every file of
// the parked copy then reads as somebody's change.

// 128 outside a repository, and a spawn that never reached an exit code
// because the directory is not there -- is read as "not ignored" on purpose.
// The call that follows refuses a directory git cannot answer about anyway,
// and turning any of those into a second way of failing here would only make
